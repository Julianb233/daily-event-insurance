## SECTION 3: STEP-BY-STEP ONBOARDING SCRIPTS

### STARTING THE ONBOARDING CONVERSATION

**If They Just Signed Up:**
> "Welcome to Daily Event Insurance, [Partner Name]! I'm so excited to help you get started. In the next few minutes, we'll get your account fully set up so you can start earning. Ready?"

**If They're Returning to Complete Setup:**
> "Welcome back, [Partner Name]! I see you started setting up your account. Let's pick up where you left off and get you live today. Sound good?"

**If They Seem Overwhelmed:**
> "Don't worry - this is easier than it looks. I'll walk you through everything step by step, and you can ask questions anytime. Most partners are completely set up in about 15 minutes. Let's take it one piece at a time."

---

### STEP 1: VERIFY BUSINESS INFORMATION

**Prompt:**
> "First, let me make sure we have your business details right. I see you entered:
> - Business Name: [name]
> - Business Type: [type]
> - Location: [location]
>
> Does everything look correct?"

**If Changes Needed:**
> "No problem! What would you like to update? I can make those changes right now."

**If Correct:**
> "Perfect! Your business profile is all set. Let's move on to customization."

---

### STEP 2: UPLOAD LOGO AND BRANDING

**Prompt:**
> "Next, let's personalize your materials. Do you have a logo you'd like to use? When customers see our insurance offering at your location, having your logo creates trust and brand consistency."

**If They Have a Logo:**
> "Great! You can upload it right in your dashboard under 'Branding'. For best results, use a PNG or SVG file with a transparent background. Need help finding where to upload?"

**If They Don't Have One:**
> "That's okay! We can use your business name instead. You can always add a logo later. For now, let's move forward."

**Technical Tips:**
- Recommended format: PNG or SVG
- Minimum size: 200x200 pixels
- Transparent background works best
- Logo will appear on QR code materials and partner landing page

---

### STEP 3: CONFIGURE PAYOUT METHOD

**Prompt:**
> "Now let's make sure you can get paid! How would you like to receive your commission payments?"

**Options:**
> "We offer two options:
> 1. **Direct Deposit** - Funds go straight to your bank account. Recommended for US businesses.
> 2. **PayPal** - Good if you prefer to keep earnings separate or are international.
>
> Which works best for you?"

**For Direct Deposit:**
> "Perfect. I'll need your bank's routing number and your account number. This is the same information you'd use for direct deposit from any employer. All data is encrypted and secure."

**For PayPal:**
> "Easy! Just provide the email address connected to your PayPal account, and we'll send payments there."

**Payout Schedule Info:**
> "Commissions are calculated monthly and paid out by the 15th of the following month. So earnings from January would be paid by February 15th. You can track your earnings in real-time in your partner dashboard."

---

### STEP 4: TAX INFORMATION (US Partners)

**Prompt:**
> "For US partners earning commissions, we'll need a W-9 form for tax purposes. This is standard for any 1099 income."

**Options:**
> "You can:
> 1. Fill out our digital W-9 right in the dashboard (takes 2 minutes)
> 2. Upload a completed W-9 PDF if you have one ready
>
> Would you like to complete it now, or would you prefer to come back to it later? Note: We can't process payouts until the W-9 is on file."

**If They Want to Do It Later:**
> "No problem! I'll flag this as incomplete. Just remember, you'll need to complete it before your first payout can be processed. I'll send you a reminder."

---

### STEP 5: SIGN PARTNER AGREEMENT

**Prompt:**
> "Almost there! The last piece of admin is our partner agreement. It's a straightforward document that covers:
> - Your commission structure (15-25%)
> - How payouts work
> - What we each agree to
> - Your ability to cancel anytime
>
> Would you like me to highlight the key points?"

**Key Points Summary:**
> "Here are the highlights:
> - You earn [X]% of every policy sold through your location
> - No minimum commitments or quotas
> - You can stop participating at any time with no penalty
> - We handle all customer support and claims
> - You agree not to misrepresent the coverage
>
> Fair and simple. Ready to sign?"

**After Signing:**
> "Excellent! Your account is now fully verified. Let's get you set up to actually start making money!"

---

### STEP 6: CHOOSE INTEGRATION METHOD

**Prompt:**
> "Now for the fun part - getting Daily Event Insurance in front of your customers! We have three main ways to do this. Let me explain each one and you can tell me what fits best."

**Option 1 - QR Codes (Easiest):**
> "**QR Codes** are the simplest option. We generate codes linked to your partner account. You print them and post them where customers will see them - front desk, near waivers, locker rooms, etc. Customers scan with their phone and purchase in 2 minutes.
>
> Best for: Businesses that want to get started TODAY with minimal effort."

**Option 2 - Website Integration:**
> "**Website Integration** lets you add insurance directly to your website. We provide embed codes for buttons, widgets, or full pages. Customers can add coverage when they book online.
>
> Best for: Businesses with strong online booking or e-commerce."

**Option 3 - POS Integration:**
> "**POS Integration** connects directly to your existing system - Mindbody, Pike13, ClubReady, and others. Insurance appears as an option during checkout.
>
> Best for: Businesses that want fully automated, seamless integration. Takes a bit longer to set up (1-2 weeks) but worth it for high volume."

**Recommendation Prompt:**
> "Based on your business type ([type]), most of our partners start with [recommendation]. Does that sound right for you, or would you prefer a different approach?"

**If They Choose QR Codes:**
> "Great choice! Let's get your QR codes right now. In your dashboard, go to 'Marketing Materials' and click 'Download QR Pack'. You'll get:
> - A poster-sized QR code
> - Table tent versions
> - Small sticker formats
> - A flyer template
>
> All pre-branded with your business info. Just print and post!"

**If They Choose Website:**
> "Perfect! In your dashboard under 'Integration', you'll find embed codes you can copy and paste into your website. If you use WordPress, Squarespace, or Wix, we have specific guides for each. Do you need help with the technical side?"

**If They Choose POS:**
> "Excellent! POS integration gives you the best long-term experience. I'll connect you with our integration team who will work with you and your POS provider to get everything set up. In the meantime, I recommend also setting up QR codes so you can start earning while the integration is being configured. Sound good?"

---

### STEP 7: DOWNLOAD AND DEPLOY MATERIALS

**For QR Code Partners:**

> "Let's get your materials downloaded and placed! Here's what I recommend:
>
> **Must-Have Placements:**
> 1. **Front desk** - Eye level, near where customers check in
> 2. **Waiver station** - If you have a separate spot for paperwork
> 3. **Waiting area** - If customers have time before their activity
>
> **Bonus Placements:**
> 4. Locker rooms
> 5. Near rental equipment
> 6. On your website/social media
>
> Have you downloaded the materials yet? Let me know when they're printing and I can give you placement tips!"

**For Website Partners:**

> "Great! Let's get your widget live. The most effective placements are:
>
> 1. **Booking confirmation page** - Right after they book, before they leave
> 2. **Day pass / drop-in page** - Where non-members purchase access
> 3. **Checkout page** - As an add-on option
>
> Have you had a chance to add the code to your site? Want me to check if it's working?"

---

### STEP 8: PREPARE YOUR TEAM

**Prompt:**
> "One more thing that makes a huge difference - making sure your front desk staff knows about this. They don't need to sell it, but they should know what it is if a customer asks."

**Staff Briefing Script:**
> "Here's what to tell your team:
>
> 'We now offer optional daily insurance coverage for our customers. There's a QR code poster at [location]. If a customer asks about it, just tell them it's optional coverage for a few dollars that protects them during their activity. They can scan the code and purchase it themselves in about 2 minutes. We don't handle any of the insurance stuff - it's all automated.'
>
> That's literally all they need to know!"

**Provide Staff Quick Reference:**
> "I can also send you a one-page staff cheat sheet with talking points and FAQ answers. Would that be helpful?"

---

### STEP 9: CONFIRM LAUNCH

**Prompt:**
> "Okay, let's do a final check. Can you confirm:
>
> ✅ QR codes are posted / widget is live?
> ✅ Staff knows what it is?
> ✅ You know how to check your dashboard?
>
> If all three are yes, you're officially launched! 🎉"

**Launch Confirmation:**
> "Congratulations! You're now a live Daily Event Insurance partner. From this moment on, any customer who scans your code and purchases coverage will earn you commission.
>
> Your first sale could come today. When it does, you'll see it in your dashboard immediately. It's an exciting feeling - our partners always remember their first one!"

---

### STEP 10: SET EXPECTATIONS AND NEXT STEPS

**What to Expect:**
> "Here's what to expect in your first week:
>
> - **Day 1-2:** You might not see much activity as customers start noticing the option
> - **Day 3-7:** Typically you'll start seeing your first sales
> - **Week 2+:** Activity patterns stabilize and you can start optimizing
>
> The average partner gets their first sale within 5 days of launching. But remember - even if it takes a bit longer, there's no cost to you while you wait."

**Check-In Schedule:**
> "I'll check in with you in about a week to see how things are going and share some tips based on what's working for other partners. Is there a good day/time for that?"

**Dashboard Walkthrough:**
> "Before we wrap up, have you explored your dashboard? Let me show you the key sections:
>
> 1. **Overview** - Your earnings at a glance
> 2. **Transactions** - Every policy sold through your account
> 3. **Payouts** - Payment history and upcoming payments
> 4. **Materials** - Download QR codes and marketing assets
> 5. **Settings** - Update your info, payout method, etc.
>
> Any questions about navigating the dashboard?"

---

## SECTION 4: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ONBOARDING ISSUES

### "I can't log in to my account"

**Steps:**
1. Confirm the email address they registered with
2. Send password reset link
3. Check spam folder for reset email
4. If still having issues, verify account status

**Response:**
> "Let's get you back in! First, what email address did you sign up with? I'll send a password reset link. Make sure to check your spam folder - sometimes our emails land there. Give me two minutes and we'll have you logged in."

---

### "My QR code isn't working"

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Test the QR code yourself
2. Check if they downloaded the right file
3. Ensure the print quality is good enough
4. Verify their partner account is active

**Response:**
> "Let's figure this out. A few things to check:
> - Is the QR code printed clearly without any blur or distortion?
> - Can you try scanning it with your own phone?
> - Did you download it from the 'Marketing Materials' section of your dashboard?
>
> If the scan leads to our website but doesn't show your business, we might need to regenerate your codes. Let me check your account."

---

### "I don't see my logo on the materials"

**Response:**
> "Logos typically appear within a few minutes of uploading. Let's check:
> 1. Go to your dashboard → Branding
> 2. Is your logo showing there?
> 3. If yes, try re-downloading the materials
>
> If your logo isn't showing in Branding, the upload might not have completed. Can you try uploading again? Make sure the file is PNG or SVG and under 5MB."

---

### "My bank information isn't being accepted"

**Response:**
> "That's frustrating - let's fix it. A few common issues:
>
> 1. **Routing number:** Must be exactly 9 digits (US banks)
> 2. **Account number:** Can vary in length - double-check for typos
> 3. **Account type:** Make sure you selected checking vs savings correctly
>
> If you're copying from your bank's website, sometimes extra spaces get added. Try typing the numbers manually. Still having trouble?"

---

### "I started the setup but got interrupted - where do I pick up?"

**Response:**
> "No problem at all! Your progress is saved. Let me pull up your account... [check status]
>
> Okay, here's where you are:
> - ✅ Account created
> - ✅ Business info entered
> - ⬜ Payout method - still needed
> - ⬜ Materials downloaded - still needed
>
> Want to continue from here? We're about [X] minutes away from having you fully launched."

---

### "I want to change my business type/category"

**Response:**
> "Sure! Your business category affects which marketing materials we generate and some operational settings. I can update it for you. What category should it be?"

**Categories:**
- Fitness/Gym
- Climbing/Bouldering
- Adventure Sports
- Equipment Rental
- Race/Event
- Wellness/Recovery
- Multi-Purpose Facility
- Other

---

### "How do I know if customers are actually buying?"

**Response:**
> "Great question! You can track everything in your dashboard:
>
> 1. Log in at dailyeventinsurance.com/partner
> 2. Click 'Transactions' in the left menu
> 3. You'll see every purchase in real-time
>
> Each entry shows:
> - Date and time of purchase
> - Activity type
> - Coverage amount
> - Your commission earned
>
> You'll also receive email notifications for your first few sales so you know the moment it happens!"

---

## SECTION 5: OPTIMIZATION TIPS TO SHARE

### After First Week:

> "Now that you've been live for a week, here are some tips that top partners use:
>
> 1. **Placement is everything** - Move your QR code to higher-traffic spots. The closer to the waiver/check-in, the better.
>
> 2. **Staff mention** - Even a brief 'Did you see the daily coverage option? QR code is right there' can significantly increase uptake.
>
> 3. **Email integration** - If you send booking confirmations, add a line about insurance with your link.
>
> 4. **Social mention** - A quick post about the new offering introduces it to your audience.
>
> Which of these haven't you tried yet?"

### Low Sales Troubleshooting:

> "I noticed your sales are a bit lower than typical. Let's troubleshoot:
>
> 1. **Visibility check:** Is the QR code in a spot where customers actually look?
> 2. **Lighting:** Can customers easily scan it? (Some locations are too dark)
> 3. **Customer type:** Are most of your customers members or drop-ins? Members may not need daily coverage.
> 4. **Staff awareness:** Do your front desk folks know it exists?
>
> Can you tell me more about your setup? I bet we can find a quick win."

### High-Performers Do This:

> "Want to know what our highest-earning partners do?
>
> 1. **Multiple touchpoints:** QR code at front desk AND in confirmation emails AND on their website
> 2. **Staff engagement:** Front desk mentions it casually: 'Don't forget about the daily coverage if you want it'
> 3. **Event promotion:** For special events, they emphasize the insurance option
> 4. **Feedback loop:** They ask customers who bought if they're glad they did (almost always yes)
>
> Any of these you'd like to try?"
