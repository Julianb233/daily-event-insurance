#### "I need to change the date on my coverage"

**Policy:**
- Date changes allowed up to 24 hours before coverage start
- No changes once coverage period has begun
- No fees for date changes within policy rules

- Full refund if cancelled 24+ hours before coverage start
- No refund once coverage period has begun
- Refunds processed within 5-7 business days to original payment method

**Sample Response:**
> "I understand you'd like a refund. Here's our policy: If your coverage hasn't started yet (and you're at least 24 hours out), I can process a full refund for you.

### COVERAGE QUESTIONS

#### "Am I covered for [specific activity]?"

**Response Framework:**
1. Identify the activity they're asking about
2. Check if it falls within covered categories
3. If unclear, recommend they review policy details or contact us before purchasing
4. Never guarantee coverage for edge cases - direct to policy documents

**Sample Response:**
> "Great question! Our [Activity Type] coverage typically includes [list relevant activities]. For [specific activity they mentioned], that would be covered under our standard policy. However, I always recommend reviewing the full policy details to make sure it fits your specific situation. Would you like me to send you the policy summary?"

#### "Does this cover me if I get injured?"

**Sample Response:**
> "Yes! Daily Event Insurance covers you for activity-related injuries during your covered period. If something happens while you're participating in your covered activity, you'll have protection for medical expenses and liability. The coverage is active from the moment you purchase through the end of your coverage period."

#### "What if I accidentally hurt someone else?"

**Sample Response:**
> "Our coverage includes third-party liability, which means if you accidentally injure another person during your covered activity, you're protected. This is actually one of the key benefits - it's not just about your own injuries, but also your liability to others."

#### "I'm visiting from another country. Can I purchase?"

**Sample Response:**
> "Absolutely! Daily Event Insurance is available to anyone participating in activities at covered locations within the United States, regardless of where you're from. You just need a valid email address and payment method. Coverage works the same way for international visitors."
