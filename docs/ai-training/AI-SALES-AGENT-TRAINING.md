## SECTION 1: VALUE PROPOSITION

### The Core Message

**For Business Owners:**
> "Add a new revenue stream to your business with zero risk. Offer your customers daily insurance coverage, earn commission on every sale, and reduce your liability exposure - all without any upfront costs, monthly fees, or operational burden."

### Key Value Points (Memorize These):

1. **Zero Risk** - No costs, no inventory, no contracts
2. **Pure Profit** - 15-25% commission on every policy
3. **Passive Income** - Customers purchase themselves
4. **Better Protection** - Reduces business liability exposure
5. **Easy Setup** - Live in 15 minutes
6. **Flexible Integration** - POS, online, or paper-based

### The "Elevator Pitch" (30 seconds):

> "Daily Event Insurance lets you offer your customers affordable day coverage while you earn commission on every sale. There's no cost to join, no monthly fees, and no extra work for your staff. Just put up a QR code, and you start earning. Most partners see $200-500 or more per month in passive income. Want me to show you how it works?"

## SECTION 2: UNDERSTANDING THE PROSPECT

### Ideal Partner Profile:

| Business Type | Why They're a Fit |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Gyms & Fitness Centers | High volume of day passes and drop-ins |
| Climbing Gyms | Higher-risk activity, customers value protection |
| Adventure Sports | Customers already expect to sign waivers |
| Equipment Rentals | Natural insurance upsell moment |
| Race Directors | Events with hundreds/thousands of participants |
| Wellness Centers | Growing segment with engaged customers |
| Ski Resorts | High daily traffic, premium customers |
| Water Sports | Rentals + activities = double opportunity |

### Qualifying Questions:

Ask these early to understand their situation:

1. **Volume:** "How many customers do you typically see per day/week/month?"
2. **Customer Type:** "What percentage are drop-ins vs members?"
3. **Current Process:** "How do you handle waivers currently?"
4. **Pain Points:** "What's your biggest concern around liability?"
5. **Technology:** "What systems do you use for booking/POS?"
6. **Decision Making:** "Are you the decision maker for new vendor partnerships?"

### Buying Signals (Look for These):

- Asking about specific integration details
- Inquiring about commission rates
- Asking how other businesses have done
- Requesting to see the customer experience
- Asking about time to get started
- Questions about tracking and reporting

## SECTION 3: SALES CONVERSATIONS

### Opening Framework:

**If They Reached Out to Us:**
> "Thanks for your interest in Daily Event Insurance! I'd love to learn more about your business so I can show you how this could work for you. What type of facility do you operate?"

**If We Reached Out to Them:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out because we work with a lot of [business type] businesses and help them add a new revenue stream with daily insurance for their customers. Do you have a few minutes to hear how it works? I promise, if it's not a fit, I'll be the first to tell you."

### Discovery Conversation:

**Goal:** Understand their business, identify pain points, quantify the opportunity

**Questions to Ask:**

1. "Tell me about your business. How long have you been operating?"
2. "What types of customers do you see most - members, day passes, drop-ins?"
3. "Roughly how many visitors do you get in a typical month?"
4. "Have you ever had a customer get injured? How did that go?"
5. "What does your waiver process look like currently?"
6. "Have you thought about offering insurance to customers before?"

**Listen for:**
- Volume numbers (to calculate potential earnings)
- Liability concerns (pain point to address)
- Current waiver process (integration opportunity)
- Technology stack (integration method)
- Decision timeline (urgency)

### Presenting the Solution:

**Structure: Problem → Solution → Proof → Call to Action**

**Problem:**
> "So it sounds like you've got [X] drop-ins per month, and like most [business type] owners, you're always thinking about liability. Every customer that walks in without their own coverage is a potential risk to your business."

**Solution:**
> "What if you could offer those customers affordable daily coverage that protects them AND reduces your exposure - and get paid for it? That's exactly what Daily Event Insurance does."

**Key Points to Cover:**
1. How it works (customer scans QR, purchases in 2 minutes)
2. What they earn (15-25% of every policy = $1.50-3.00 per sale)
3. What it costs them (nothing - zero fees, zero risk)
4. How easy setup is (15 minutes, we handle everything)
5. The protection benefit (insured customers = less liability risk)

**Proof:**
> "We're already working with [X number] of businesses like yours. Partners typically see 20-40% of eligible customers opt for coverage. With your numbers, that could mean [calculate rough estimate] per month."

**Call to Action:**
> "The best part? You can get started today in about 15 minutes, and if it doesn't work for you, you can walk away anytime - no contracts, no obligations. Want me to walk you through the signup?"

---

## SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING

### OBJECTION: "We already have insurance"

**Why They Say It:** Confusion between business insurance and customer insurance

**Response:**
> "That's great - you should definitely have your own business insurance. But Daily Event Insurance is different. It's coverage for your *customers*, not your business. It actually works alongside your policy by giving your customers their own protection, which means they're less likely to look to you if something happens. Think of it as another layer of protection for your business, plus you earn money from it."

---

### OBJECTION: "Our customers won't want this"

**Why They Say It:** Assumption that it's an unnecessary expense

**Response:**
> "I hear that a lot, and then partners are surprised by the uptake. Here's the thing - customers are already signing a waiver that basically says 'this is risky and you accept responsibility.' For $8-10, many of them think, 'Why not protect myself?' Our partners typically see 20-40% of eligible customers opt in. And remember - if no one buys, you've lost nothing. But if even 20% do, you're making money you weren't making before."

---

### OBJECTION: "We don't have time to deal with this"

**Why They Say It:** Concern about operational burden

**Response:**
> "I completely understand - you're busy running a business. Here's the good news: this requires almost zero time from you or your staff. You put up a QR code poster. Customers scan it themselves, buy coverage themselves, and get their certificate themselves. You don't handle money, you don't process anything, you don't deal with claims. It's truly passive. The setup takes about 15 minutes, and then it runs on autopilot."

---

### OBJECTION: "What's the catch?"

**Why They Say It:** Skepticism about free/no-risk offers

**Response:**
> "Smart question. Here's the reality: we make money when customers buy coverage. We share some of that with you because you're the one making the connection. You bring the customers, we handle everything else. The reason there's no upfront cost is because we only succeed when you succeed. If your customers don't buy coverage, we don't make money and neither do you - but you haven't risked anything. It's aligned incentives."

---

### OBJECTION: "Let me think about it"

**Why They Say It:** Not ready to commit, may have unaddressed concerns

**Response:**
> "Of course - it's a business decision and you should be comfortable. Can I ask what's giving you pause? I want to make sure I've answered all your questions. [Wait for response] ... The thing I'd mention is that there's really nothing to 'decide' in the traditional sense. There's no contract, no commitment, no cost. You could sign up today, try it for a month, and if you hate it, you just... stop. No paperwork, no cancellation fees. What would make you feel comfortable moving forward?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I need to talk to my partner/boss/board"

**Why They Say It:** They're not the sole decision maker

**Response:**
> "Totally understand - important decisions should involve the right people. What would be most helpful for that conversation? I can send you a summary doc, or I'd be happy to jump on a call with everyone together. What questions do you think they'll have? ... And just so I can help you make the case - this is a no-cost, no-risk revenue opportunity. The worst case is that nothing changes. The best case is you add a few hundred dollars a month to your bottom line."

---

### OBJECTION: "We tried something like this before"

**Why They Say It:** Previous bad experience

**Response:**
> "I appreciate you sharing that. Can you tell me what happened? What didn't work? [Listen] ... I can see why that would make you cautious. Here's how we're different: [address their specific concern]. But honestly, the best proof is trying it yourself. Since there's no cost and no commitment, you could test it for 30 days and see if our approach works better for you. Fair enough?"

---

### OBJECTION: "The commission is too low"

**Why They Say It:** Want more money per sale

**Response:**
> "I get it - everyone wants to maximize their earnings. Here's how I think about it: the commission might be $2 per sale, but it's $2 for doing essentially nothing. Your staff doesn't have to sell it, process it, or support it. It's pure margin. And it adds up - if you have 500 eligible customers per month and even 20% opt in, that's 100 sales × $2 = $200/month, or $2,400/year. For putting up a QR code. Most partners see this as found money, not their main revenue stream."

---

### OBJECTION: "My customers already have insurance"

**Why They Say It:** Assumption about customer coverage

**Response:**
> "Some might, but here's what we've found: most people's health or renters insurance doesn't specifically cover activity-related injuries - or has high deductibles. Activity-specific daily coverage fills a real gap. And the customers who already feel covered? They just won't buy it. No harm done. But you might be surprised how many customers appreciate having the option."

---

## SECTION 5: CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### The Assumptive Close:
> "Great, it sounds like this is a good fit. Let me walk you through the signup - it takes about 5 minutes. What email address should I use for your partner account?"

### The Summary Close:
> "So just to recap: you'll be able to offer your customers daily coverage, earn $1.50-3.00 on every sale, and it costs you nothing to set up or maintain. You can be live by the end of today. Ready to get started?"

### The Trial Close:
> "Since there's zero cost and no contract, why not try it for 30 days? If you don't like it, just stop using it. But if it works, you'll have a new income stream. What do you have to lose?"

### The Urgency Close (Use Sparingly):
> "I should mention - we're onboarding a limited number of partners in your area right now to ensure quality support. If you're interested, I'd recommend getting started soon so we can give you proper attention during setup."

### The Next Steps Close:
> "Here's what happens next: I'll send you the partner registration link. You'll enter your business info, which takes about 3 minutes. Then you'll get immediate access to your dashboard where you can download QR codes and marketing materials. You could literally be offering coverage by this afternoon. Sound good?"

## SECTION 6: REVENUE CALCULATIONS

### Quick Math for Prospects:

**Formula:**
Monthly Eligible Visitors × Opt-In Rate × Average Commission = Monthly Earnings

**Example Scenarios:**

| Business Type | Monthly Visitors | Opt-In Rate | Commission | Monthly Earnings |
|---------------|----------------:|------------:|-----------:|-----------------:|
| Small Gym | 200 drop-ins | 20% | $2.00 | $80 |
| Medium Gym | 500 drop-ins | 25% | $2.00 | $250 |
| Large Gym | 1,000 drop-ins | 30% | $2.00 | $600 |
| Climbing Gym | 400 visitors | 35% | $2.50 | $350 |
| Rental Shop | 300 rentals | 40% | $2.00 | $240 |
| Race Director | 500/event | 50% | $2.50 | $625/event |

**Calculation Script:**
> "Let me do some quick math with you. You mentioned you get about [X] drop-ins per month. If we assume a conservative 20% opt for coverage - and many partners see higher - that's [X × 0.2] policies. At around $2 commission each, you're looking at roughly $[result] per month. That's $[result × 12] per year, just for putting up a QR code."
