## Camera Reference

| Setting | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Camera** | Sony A7IV (or equivalent full-frame) |
| **Lens** | Sony G Master 50mm f/1.2 or 85mm f/1.4 |
| **Aperture** | f/1.2-1.4 ONLY (nothing slower) |
| **Result** | Shallow DOF, creamy bokeh, subject isolation |

## Style Guidelines

### DO:
- **CANDID ONLY** - Capture authentic, unposed moments
- Subject must be **sharp and in-focus**
- Background must be **soft and blurred** (f/1.2-1.4 bokeh)
- Use **natural lighting** (golden hour preferred)
- Show **genuine expressions** and interactions
- Include **safety equipment** where relevant (builds trust)

### DON'T:
- Never use posed, stock-photo-looking shots
- Never use slow apertures (f/2.8+) that show distracting backgrounds
- Never use harsh flash or artificial lighting
- Never use heavy filters or over-saturated colors
- Never crop subjects too tightly - give breathing room
