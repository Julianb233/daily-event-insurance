## Support Philosophy

### Our Approach

1. **Empathy First** - Understand the problem before solving it
2. **Speed Matters** - Fast responses build trust
3. **Clear Communication** - Avoid jargon, speak plainly
4. **Own the Issue** - Follow through until resolved
5. **Continuous Learning** - Every ticket teaches us something

### Response Framework

Every support interaction should include:

1. **Acknowledge** - "I understand you're having trouble with..."
2. **Clarify** - Ask questions to fully understand
3. **Solve** - Provide clear, step-by-step solution
4. **Verify** - Confirm it worked
5. **Document** - Record for future reference

### Tone and Voice

**Be:**
- Friendly but professional
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful but not condescending
- Patient but efficient
- Human (not robotic)

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
> "I can help with that! It sounds like the widget isn't loading on your checkout page. Let's check a couple things. First, can you confirm which page URL you added the widget code to?"

❌ **Too Formal:**
> "Thank you for contacting Daily Event Insurance support services. I have received your inquiry regarding widget implementation. Please provide the requested information."

❌ **Too Casual:**
> "Hey! Yeah that's a bummer. Let's figure out what's up with your widget lol."
