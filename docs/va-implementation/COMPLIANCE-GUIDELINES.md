|-------------|----------------|
| "This policy covers everything" | "I can send you the full coverage details" |
| "You'll definitely be covered if..." | "Our licensed team can explain the specific coverage" |
| "I guarantee the claim will be paid" | "Claims are processed per the policy terms" |
| "You don't need any other insurance" | "This is designed to complement existing coverage" |
| "Trust me, it's the right coverage" | "Let me connect you with someone who can review your needs" |

## Call Recording Consent

### Compliance Requirement

All calls through GoHighLevel are recorded. You MUST obtain consent at the start of each outbound call.

### Required Disclosure Script

**For Outbound Calls:**
> "Hi [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] from Daily Event Insurance. 
> Before we continue, I want to let you know this call may be 
> recorded for quality and training purposes. Is that okay?"

**If They Decline Recording:**
> "No problem at all. Let me take some notes instead. 
> [Proceed with call but note 'Recording declined' in GHL]"

**For Inbound Calls:**
Your greeting should include:
> "Thank you for calling Daily Event Insurance. This call may 
> be recorded for quality purposes."

### State-Specific Rules

- **One-party consent states:** Disclosure is still required per company policy
- **Two-party consent states (CA, FL, IL, etc.):** Disclosure is legally required
- **When in doubt:** Always disclose

## Escalation Requirements

### Immediate Escalation Triggers

Transfer or schedule callback with licensed agent for:

1. **Coverage Questions**
   - "What exactly does this cover?"
   - "What are the exclusions?"
   - "Is [specific activity] covered?"
   - "What are the limits?"

2. **Claims Questions**
   - "How do I file a claim?"
   - "I had an incident and need to claim"
   - "Why was my claim denied?"
   - "What documentation is needed for claims?"

3. **Legal Questions**
   - "Can you send me the policy contract?"
   - "What are the legal terms?"
   - "Who is the underwriter?"
   - "Is this regulated in my state?"

4. **Advice-Seeking Questions**
   - "Do you think I need this?"
   - "What would you recommend?"
   - "Is this enough coverage for my gym?"
   - "Should I replace my current insurance with this?"

### Escalation Response Template

> "That's an excellent question. Since that involves specific 
> insurance details, I want to make sure you get accurate information 
> from one of our licensed specialists. Can I have them call you back 
> within [timeframe], or would you prefer to schedule a specific time?"

## Do Not Call (DNC) Compliance

### TCPA Requirements

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act requires:

1. **Honor opt-out requests immediately** - No exceptions
2. **Maintain internal DNC list** - We use GHL tags for this
3. **Check DNC before calling** - GHL workflow handles this
4. **Document all DNC requests** - In contact notes

### DNC Processing

When someone requests DNC:

1. **Stop immediately** - Do not try to convince them otherwise
2. **Confirm** - "I've removed you from our call list."
3. **Tag in GHL** - Add `Call - Do Not Call` tag
4. **Document** - Note the request with timestamp
5. **Remove from workflows** - Remove from all sequences

### DNC Phrases to Recognize

All of these count as DNC requests:
- "Stop calling me"
- "Take me off your list"
- "Don't call again"
- "Remove my number"
- "I'm not interested, don't contact me"
- "This is harassment" (handle carefully, escalate to lead)

---

## Data Privacy & Security

### Information Handling

- **Never share** prospect information with unauthorized parties
- **Never discuss** one prospect's details with another
- **Always verify** identity before sharing account information
- **Never screenshot** or copy data outside of GHL
- **Log out** of GHL when stepping away

### Sensitive Information

If a prospect shares sensitive information:
- Don't write down SSNs, full credit card numbers
- Bank details should only go in secure payment forms
- Medical information - note only what's essential for coverage type

### Breach Protocol

If you suspect a data breach or mistake:
1. Stop immediately
2. Document what happened
3. Contact team lead immediately
4. Do not try to "fix it" without guidance

---

## Prohibited Practices

### Never Do These

1. **Misrepresent your role** - Don't claim to be a licensed agent
2. **Make unauthorized promises** - Stick to documented features
3. **Disparage competitors** - Stay positive, don't trash talk
4. **Share internal metrics** - Call volumes, conversion rates are confidential
5. **Use personal devices for calls** - Always use approved systems
6. **Continue after DNC request** - Zero tolerance policy
7. **Fabricate information** - If you don't know, say so and find out

### Zero Tolerance Issues

The following result in immediate review/termination:
- Fraudulent activity
- Intentional compliance violations
- Harassment or discrimination
- Sharing confidential data
- Ignoring DNC requests

## Disclaimers to Include

### Email Footer (Standard)

```
Daily Event Insurance partners with [Underwriter] to provide 
coverage options. All coverage is subject to policy terms 
and conditions. This email is for informational purposes only 
and does not constitute insurance advice.
```

### Verbal Disclaimer (When Needed)

When discussing coverage specifics:
> "I want to mention that I'm not a licensed insurance agent, 
> so for detailed coverage questions, our licensed team is the 
> best resource. But I'm happy to help with general information 
> and get you connected."

---

## State-Specific Considerations

### High-Regulation States

These states have additional requirements - always escalate complex questions:
- **California** - CCPA privacy rights, two-party consent
- **New York** - DFS regulations
- **Florida** - Two-party consent, specific insurance rules
- **Texas** - TDI regulations

### If Unsure

When a prospect mentions state-specific regulations or requirements:
> "Great question. Insurance regulations can vary by state, so let 
> me have one of our team members who specializes in [STATE] 
> compliance follow up with you. They'll be able to give you the 
> most accurate information."
