**Purpose:** Reference document for VA calls to answer common partner questions

## How It Works

### "What exactly is Daily Event Insurance?"

> "Daily Event Insurance is an embedded insurance platform that lets businesses 
> like yours offer same-day accident and liability coverage to your customers. 
> When someone comes to your gym, climbing wall, or rents equipment, they can 
> purchase coverage right at check-in. You earn a commission on each policy, 
> and your customers get peace of mind."

### "How is this different from my business insurance?"

> "Great question. Your business liability insurance protects YOUR business 
> from lawsuits. What we offer is participant accident coverage that YOUR 
> CUSTOMERS purchase to protect themselves. It actually complements your 
> insurance by reducing potential claims against your policy. Think of it 
> as an additional layer of protection that benefits everyone."

### "Do I need this if I already have waivers?"

> "Waivers are important and you should definitely keep them. But waivers 
> don't provide coverage when someone gets injured - they just limit your 
> liability. Our coverage gives your customers actual protection. Many 
> facilities find that offering insurance alongside waivers creates a 
> more complete safety package and can actually help with waiver 
> enforcement."

## Integration & Setup

### "How long does setup take?"

> "Most partners are up and running in 2-3 hours total. We handle the 
> technical integration - you just need to provide access to your 
> check-in system or website. After setup, there's no daily work 
> required from your staff."

### "What systems do you integrate with?"

> "We work with most major gym management systems including Mindbody, 
> ClubReady, ABC Fitness, and many others. We also have a simple widget 
> that works with any website. If you have a custom system, our team 
> can usually build a connection. What system are you currently using?"

### "Do we need to train our staff?"

> "Minimal training is needed - usually a 15-minute overview. The coverage 
> is presented automatically at check-in, so your staff doesn't need to 
> 'sell' it. We provide a simple guide and talking points in case 
> customers have questions."

### "What if our system isn't compatible?"

> "We have several integration options. If your management software isn't 
> directly supported, we can use our standalone kiosk solution, a tablet 
> at your front desk, or a QR code that customers scan. Let me connect 
> you with our integration team to find the best fit."

## Coverage & Claims

### "What does the coverage include?"

> "I can give you the general overview, but for specific policy details, 
> our licensed team can provide the complete information. Generally, 
> coverage includes accident medical expenses, and depending on the 
> product, may include equipment coverage and additional benefits. 
> Shall I have our specialist reach out with the detailed breakdown?"

### "How much does coverage cost customers?"

> "Coverage typically ranges from $5 to $15 per day depending on the 
> activity type. Gyms are usually on the lower end, while adventure 
> sports or high-risk rentals may be slightly higher. It's designed 
> to be affordable enough that customers see it as a reasonable 
> add-on for peace of mind."

### "What happens if someone needs to file a claim?"

> "The claims process is handled entirely by our team. Customers 
> receive a claims email with their policy, and our claims department 
> processes everything. Partners aren't involved in the claims process, 
> so it doesn't create any administrative burden for you."

### "How quickly are claims processed?"

> "Most claims are processed within 24-48 hours of receiving 
> complete documentation. For specific claims questions, I'd want 
> to connect you with our claims team who can provide more details."

## Revenue & Business Model

### "How do we make money from this?"

> "You earn a commission on every policy sold through your location. 
> Commissions typically range from 15-25% of the policy price. For a 
> busy location, this can add up to several hundred to several thousand 
> dollars per month in pure profit, with no work required from your team."

### "What's the cost to us?"

> "There's no cost to implement or maintain. No monthly fees, no 
> minimums, no hardware to purchase. We handle everything - you just 
> provide access to your system and earn commissions on sales."

### "When and how do we get paid?"

> "Commissions are paid monthly via ACH direct deposit. You'll have 
> access to a partner portal where you can see real-time sales and 
> commission tracking. Payments are typically processed within the 
> first week of each month for the previous month's sales."

### "What kind of revenue can we expect?"

> "It varies by location, but we've seen partners earn anywhere from 
> $200/month for smaller facilities to $5,000+ for high-volume locations. 
> The key factors are daily foot traffic and what percentage of customers 
> opt for coverage. Would you like me to walk through a revenue estimate 
> based on your volume?"

## Customer Experience

### "Will this slow down our check-in process?"

> "Not at all. The coverage offer is integrated into your existing flow - 
> it adds about 10-15 seconds. Customers see the option, tap yes or no, 
> and continue. We've specifically designed it to be frictionless because 
> we know speed matters at check-in."

### "What if customers complain about being asked?"

> "We've found that when positioned correctly - as an optional benefit, 
> not a requirement - customers appreciate having the option. The key is 
> that it's presented as 'Would you like coverage today?' not 'You need 
> to buy this.' If any customers do express concerns, we can adjust the 
> messaging."

### "Can customers decline coverage?"

> "Absolutely - it's always optional. We never want customers to feel 
> pressured. They simply tap 'No thanks' and continue with their visit. 
> Our data shows about 15-30% of eligible customers opt in, which is a 
> healthy rate that generates revenue without creating friction."

### "What about members vs. day passes?"

> "That's configurable. Many partners only offer coverage to day-pass 
> visitors or first-timers, since regular members may have their own 
> coverage. We can customize the display rules based on visit type, 
> membership status, or other criteria."

## Technical & Support

### "Who do we contact if there are issues?"

> "You'll have a dedicated partner success contact for any questions. 
> For urgent technical issues, we have a support line and email that 
> responds within hours during business days. You'll also have access 
> to the partner portal for real-time monitoring."

### "What if the system goes down?"

> "Our platform has 99.9% uptime and redundant systems. If there ever 
> is an outage, your check-in continues to work normally - the insurance 
> offer just won't appear until we're back online. We have monitoring 
> that alerts us immediately to any issues."

### "Can we white-label this with our branding?"

> "Yes, we offer customization options. Your logo, colors, and messaging 
> can be incorporated so it feels like part of your brand experience. 
> We'll work with you during setup to match your look and feel."

## Common Objections

### "We're too busy to implement something new"

> "I completely understand. That's exactly why we've designed this to 
> be hands-off. The setup takes 2-3 hours with our team doing the heavy 
> lifting, and after that it runs automatically. You're generating 
> revenue without adding any work to your daily operations."

### "Our members won't pay for this"

> "That's a common concern, but what we've found is that a segment of 
> your customers - especially first-timers, visitors, and safety-conscious 
> folks - really value having this option. Since it's optional, you're 
> not requiring anyone to buy, just giving them the choice. And the 
> customers who do opt in generate meaningful revenue for you."

### "We tried something like this before and it didn't work"

> "I'd love to understand what happened. Was it the integration, the 
> customer experience, the product itself? We've built Daily Event 
> Insurance specifically to address the common problems - like clunky 
> check-in flows and low adoption. Can you share what went wrong 
> last time so I can show you how we've solved those issues?"

### "I need to think about it / talk to my partner"

> "Of course, take the time you need. Can I send you our partner 
> overview document to share? And when would be a good time for me 
> to follow up? I want to make sure I'm available to answer any 
> questions that come up."
