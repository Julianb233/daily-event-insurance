## COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### "What does it cover?"

> "It covers you for activity-related injuries while you're here. If something happens, you have your own coverage to help with medical costs."

### "Do I really need it?"

> "It's completely optional. But for a few dollars, you get peace of mind. Most people think it's worth it - especially for more active workouts or if it's your first time."

### "I have health insurance."

> "Great! This works alongside it. Health insurance doesn't always cover activity-related injuries fully, and this gives you additional protection specific to what you're doing today."

### "Is it complicated?"

> "Not at all. Scan this code, answer 4-5 questions, pay, and you're covered. Under 2 minutes."

### "What if I come regularly?"

> "We offer it for each visit - it's designed for drop-ins and day passes. If you're a member, you might want to check your membership benefits."
