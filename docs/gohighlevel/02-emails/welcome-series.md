## Email 3: Value Proposition (Day 3)

**Template Name**: `DEI - Value Proposition`  
**Subject Line**: `How {{contact.company_name}} Can Earn $1,000+/Month`  
**Delay**: 2 days after Email 2

### Email Body

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

Quick question: How many members check in at {{contact.company_name}} each day?

Here's why I ask:

**Real Partner Results:**
• **Altitude Climbing Gym** (Denver) – 200 daily check-ins → **$1,847/month** in commissions
• **FitLife Studios** (Miami) – 150 daily check-ins → **$1,234/month** in commissions
• **Coastal Kayak Rentals** (San Diego) – 40 daily rentals → **$892/month** in commissions

The math is simple:
📊 Average 15-20% of members add insurance at $5/day
💰 You earn 20% commission on every policy

For a facility with 100 daily check-ins:
= ~18 policies/day × $1 commission = $18/day × 30 days = **$540/month**

And that's a conservative estimate!

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back.

I completely understand—you're busy running {{contact.company_name}}!

I just need to know if I should:

**A)** Keep your file open for when timing is better  
**B)** Close it out for now

Just reply with A or B, and I'll take care of the rest.

If there's a better time for us to connect, let me know. We're here whenever you're ready.
