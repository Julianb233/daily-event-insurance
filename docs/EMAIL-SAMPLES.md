## GYM VERTICAL

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject**: `Mike - Add $3,200/mo to Summit Fitness (5 min setup)`

**Body**:
```
Mike,

I'll be direct: your members are already buying insurance. You're just not getting paid for it.

What if every member who walked through your door generated an extra $14 in commission for you?

Here's what happens:
• We integrate with your check-in system (5 minutes)
• Members opt in to daily coverage ($40/policy)
• You earn 35% commission on every policy
• Monthly recurring revenue starts flowing

Based on your member count, that's approximately $3,200 per month in pure profit.

No contracts. No risk. No overhead. Just additional revenue.

P.S. We handle everything - underwriting, claims, customer support. You literally just collect checks. Reply "INFO" for the one-pager.
```

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject**: `Re: $3,200/mo for Summit Fitness`

**Body**:
```
Mike,

Quick question:

If I could show you how to add $3,200 in monthly recurring revenue to Summit Fitness - with zero work on your end - would you give me 15 minutes?

Not a pitch. Just showing you the numbers and how it works.

Yes or no?

- Daily Event Insurance Team
```

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject**: `Last email (promise) - Summit Fitness`

**Body**:
```
Mike,

I'll make this simple.

Three gyms your size added this last month. All three are making an extra $2,800-$4,200/month.

It took them 5 minutes to set up. Zero ongoing work.

Either you want free money or you don't.

Reply "YES" if you want me to send the details.
Reply "NO" if I should stop emailing you.

## WELLNESS VERTICAL

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject**: `Dr. Sarah - Turn treatments into recurring revenue at Glow Wellness`

**Body**:
```
Dr. Sarah,

Your clients trust you with their bodies. That's worth something.

Every IV drip, laser treatment, or aesthetic procedure you perform = $14 in commission for you.

The numbers for Glow Wellness:
• $40 insurance per treatment
• 35% commission = $14 profit per policy
• 95% of your clients say yes (industry avg)
• Estimated: $4,200/month recurring

You add liability protection. Your clients get peace of mind. You get paid monthly.

Setup: 5 minutes. Ongoing work: Zero. Risk: None.

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject**: `Re: Monthly recurring revenue for Glow Wellness`

**Body**:
```
Dr. Sarah,

Last week, a spa owner told me: "I wish I'd done this 5 years ago."

She's now making $4,800/month in commissions. Same number of clients. Zero extra work.

The setup took 7 minutes on a Zoom call.

That's it. That's the email.

Reply YES or NO.

- Daily Event Insurance
```

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject**: `Breakup email - Glow Wellness`

**Body**:
```
Dr. Sarah,

I'll stop bothering you after this.

But I'd hate for you to miss out on $50,400 per year because my emails got lost in your inbox.

Just reply:

"SHOW ME" - I'll send you a 2-minute video of exactly how it works
"NOT NOW" - I'll check back in 6 months
"NEVER" - I'll remove you from my list

That's it.

## SKI RESORT VERTICAL

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject**: `Tom - Add $81,750/season to Alpine Mountain Resort`

**Body**:
```
Tom,

Every skier who buys a lift ticket is a potential insurance policy.

Most resorts ignore this revenue stream entirely.

Here's the model:
• Integrate at ticket purchase (one-time 10 min setup)
• Visitors add $40 daily coverage at checkout
• You earn $14 per policy sold
• Typical opt-in: 60-75% of daily visitors

Conservative estimate for Alpine Mountain Resort: $81,750 per season.

We handle everything: integration, customer service, claims, compliance.

You just collect commissions.

P.S. Peak season is coming. Get set up now before your busy period hits. Takes less time than this email took you to read.
```

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject**: `Tom - Math doesn't lie`

**Body**:
```
Tom,

Let me make this even simpler.

If you sell 300 lift tickets per day during peak season...
And 65% add insurance (industry average)...
That's 195 policies × $14 commission = $2,730 per day.

Run that for a 120-day season = $327,600.

The math doesn't lie.

Reply YES if you want me to run your actual numbers.

- Daily Event Insurance
```

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject**: `One question - Alpine Mountain Resort`

**Body**:
```
Tom,

Do you want an extra $81,750 this season or not?

Because if you do, I can have you set up by end of week.

If you don't, just let me know so I stop emailing.

Simple as that.

## FITNESS EVENTS VERTICAL

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject**: `Jessica - $14 profit per participant at Spartan Events`

**Body**:
```

You're leaving money on the table.

Every race participant, bootcamp attendee, or fitness event registration is worth $14 to you.

The opportunity for Spartan Events:
• Add insurance option to registration (checkbox)
• $40 per participant for event day coverage
• You earn 35% = $14 commission per policy
• Est. annual: $18,000

Your participants get better protection. You get better margins.

No minimum. No contract. No overhead.

P.S. Race directors using this see 82% opt-in rates. That's 8 out of 10 participants choosing coverage. Free money for you.
```

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject**: `Real numbers from real events`

**Body**:
```
Jessica,

Last month:
• Spartan Race (500 participants): $5,740 commission

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject**: `Final follow-up - Spartan Events`

**Body**:
```
Jessica,

Last email, I promise.

Two options:

1) Reply "INFO" - I'll send you the complete breakdown
2) Reply "REMOVE" - I'll never email you again

Either way, I respect your time.
