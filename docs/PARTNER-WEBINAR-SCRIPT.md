## WEBINAR SCRIPT

### SLIDE 1: OPENING (2 minutes)

**[Show: Title slide with Daily Event Insurance logo]**

> "Welcome everyone! Thank you for taking time out of your busy day to learn about what I believe is one of the easiest revenue opportunities you'll ever add to your business.
>
> I'm [NAME], and in the next 30 minutes, I'm going to show you how to:
> - Add a new revenue stream with ZERO upfront cost
> - Better protect your customers AND your business
> - Get started in literally 15 minutes
>
> And here's the best part - there's absolutely no risk. None. If nobody buys, you've lost nothing. If they do buy, you earn commission on every single policy.
>
> Sound good? Let's dive in."

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE (3 minutes)

**[Show: Stats about liability and uninsured participants]**

> "Let me ask you something. How many people walk through your doors every week?
>
> [PAUSE for engagement]
>
> Now, how many of them do you think have personal liability coverage for activities at your facility?
>
> The answer might surprise you. Studies show that over 70% of participants in fitness, adventure, and recreational activities have NO dedicated coverage for activity-related injuries.
>
> What does that mean for you?
>
> It means when something goes wrong - and in our industry, things do happen - that uninsured customer might be looking at YOU to cover their medical bills. Even with a signed waiver, you can still face legal battles that cost time, money, and reputation.
>
> But here's the flip side. What if you could offer your customers protection that:
> - Covers them during their activity
> - Reduces YOUR liability exposure
> - AND puts money in your pocket?
>
> That's exactly what Daily Event Insurance does."

---

### SLIDE 3: WHAT IS DAILY EVENT INSURANCE? (4 minutes)

**[Show: Product overview with key features]**

> "Daily Event Insurance is short-term, activity-specific liability coverage that protects participants during their time at your facility or event.
>
> Here's what makes it special:

> - No annual policies, no long-term commitments
> - Perfect for drop-ins, day passes, first-timers, and event participants

> - Most customers see this as a no-brainer for peace of mind"

---

### SLIDE 4: THE PARTNER OPPORTUNITY (5 minutes)

**[Show: Revenue calculator / commission structure]**

> "Now let's talk about why YOU should care about this.
>
> As a Daily Event Insurance partner, you earn commission on every policy sold through your business. Let me break down the numbers:
>
> **COMMISSION STRUCTURE**
> - You earn 15-25% commission on every policy
> - Average policy value: $8-12
> - That's $1.50 to $3.00 in your pocket per sale
>
> **LET'S DO THE MATH**
>
> Say you have 500 visitors per month who are good candidates for daily coverage - drop-ins, day passes, event participants, rental customers.
>
> If just 20% opt for insurance (and we see much higher rates with good placement):
> - 100 policies per month
> - Average $2 commission per policy
> - **That's $200/month or $2,400/year in pure profit**
>
> And here's the beautiful part - you're not doing any extra work. The customer buys it themselves. You're just making it available.
>
> I've seen partners with high-traffic locations generate $500-1,000+ per month once they optimize their integration."

### SLIDE 5: ZERO RISK, ALL UPSIDE (3 minutes)

**[Show: "No Risk" graphic with checkmarks]**

> "I want to be crystal clear about this because I know you've heard pitches before.
>
> **THERE IS ZERO RISK TO YOU.**
>
> Let me count the ways:
>
> ✅ **No upfront costs** - Free to sign up, free to integrate
>
> ✅ **No monthly fees** - You never pay us anything, ever
>
> ✅ **No inventory** - It's digital. Nothing to stock or manage
>
> ✅ **No customer service burden** - We handle all claims and support
>
> ✅ **No contracts** - Month to month. Don't like it? Walk away anytime
>
> ✅ **No sales pressure** - You're not selling. You're offering an option
>
> The ONLY thing that happens if nobody buys insurance is... nothing. You've lost nothing. Your customers have the same experience they had before.
>
> But if they DO buy? You earn money. They get protected. Your liability exposure decreases. Everyone wins.
>
> This is literally the definition of 'all upside, no downside.'"

---

### SLIDE 6: BETTER PROTECTION FOR YOUR BUSINESS (4 minutes)

**[Show: Liability shield graphic]**

> "Now, let's talk about something that keeps every business owner up at night: liability.
>
> When a customer purchases Daily Event Insurance, something powerful happens:
>
> **1. PRIMARY COVERAGE SHIFTS**
> The customer's insurance becomes the FIRST line of defense for activity-related incidents. That means if something happens, their policy responds before anyone looks at you.
>
> **2. REDUCED LITIGATION RISK**
> Insured customers are statistically LESS likely to sue. Why? Because they have coverage. They're not desperate. They have a claims process that handles their needs.
>
> **3. DEMONSTRATED DUE DILIGENCE**
> Offering insurance to your customers shows you take safety seriously. If something ever does go to court, you can demonstrate that you proactively offered protection.
>
> **4. WAIVER REINFORCEMENT**
> When customers are buying insurance, they're acknowledging there's inherent risk. This actually strengthens your waiver position.
>
> I'm not saying insurance eliminates all liability. But it creates layers of protection that significantly reduce your exposure. Think of it as armor for your business."

### SLIDE 7: INTEGRATION OPTIONS (6 minutes)

**[Show: Three integration paths with icons]**

> "Now here's where the rubber meets the road. How do you actually make this available to your customers?
>
> We've designed three integration paths to fit ANY business setup:

---

> **OPTION 1: POS INTEGRATION**
>
> If you use a modern point-of-sale system like Mindbody, ClubReady, Pike13, or similar, we can often integrate directly.
>
> Here's how it works:
> - Insurance option appears automatically during checkout
> - Customer adds it with one click
> - Everything is tracked in your dashboard
> - Commission calculated automatically
>
> This is the 'set it and forget it' approach. Once integrated, it runs on autopilot.
>
> Popular systems we integrate with:
> - Mindbody
> - Pike13
> - ClubReady
> - Zen Planner
> - WaiverForever
> - Custom APIs available

---

> **OPTION 2: ONLINE / E-COMMERCE**
>
> Selling passes online? Perfect.
>
> We provide you with:
> - A branded landing page for your customers
> - Embed widgets for your website
> - Links to include in confirmation emails
> - QR codes for anywhere you need them
>
> The flow is simple:
> 1. Customer books their class/rental/event
> 2. They see option to add insurance
> 3. They purchase directly through our platform
> 4. Done. You earn commission.
>
> Works beautifully for:
> - Online class bookings
> - Equipment rental reservations
> - Event registrations
> - Membership portals

---

> **OPTION 3: PAPER / IN-PERSON**
>
> Not everyone is digital, and that's totally fine.
>
> We provide:
> - Printed QR code posters for your front desk
> - Flyers to hand out with waivers
> - Table tents for high-traffic areas
> - Staff talking points
>
> The customer simply scans the QR code, answers a few questions, pays, and they're covered. Takes less than 2 minutes on their phone.
>
> This works great for:
> - Walk-in customers
> - Paper waiver businesses
> - Events and competitions
> - Anywhere with high foot traffic

---

> **MIX AND MATCH**
>
> Here's the thing - you don't have to choose just one. Most partners use a combination:
> - POS integration for regular bookings
> - QR codes at the front desk for walk-ins
> - Links in confirmation emails for online reservations
>
> Cover all your bases."

**[Show: Testimonial quotes and stats]**

> "Don't just take my word for it. Here's what our partners are experiencing:

---

> **SUMMIT CLIMBING GYM - Portland, OR**
> 'We added the QR code to our waiver packet. Within the first month, 35% of day-pass customers were opting in. That's an extra $400/month we weren't making before.'

---

> **COASTAL KAYAK RENTALS - San Diego, CA**
> 'Every rental now gets asked if they want protection. It's a natural fit when you're handing someone a $2,000 kayak. Our insurance attach rate is over 40%.'

---

> **IRON TRIBE FITNESS - Multiple Locations**
> 'We integrated with our booking system. Members see the option when they sign up for classes. It's completely passive income at this point.'

### SLIDE 11: COMMON QUESTIONS (4 minutes)

**[Show: FAQ layout]**

---

> **Q: How do I get paid?**
> A: Monthly payouts via direct deposit or check. Full reporting in your partner dashboard.

---

> **Q: Does this replace my business insurance?**
> A: No. This is coverage for your CUSTOMERS, not your business. You still need your own liability policy. This is an additional layer that protects them and reduces your exposure.

---

> **Q: What activities are covered?**
> A: Fitness, climbing, adventure sports, equipment rentals, races, wellness services. If it's active and carries some risk, we probably cover it. Check with us if you're unsure.
